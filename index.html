		<h1>MasterKey: Practical Backdoor Attack Against Speaker Verification Systems </h1>
		<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 12px;"></div>
		<p>We present a practical a new backdoor attack on the
            Speaker Verification models named MasterKey. Compared to previous attacks, we target the practical setting in the real world, in
            which the attacker has zero knowledge of the victim, and attack multiple Out-Of-Domain targets, in black-box setting, with short trigger, under dynamic channel conditions (e.g., over-the-air, over-the-telephony network)</b>. Below we list the commercial usage of Voice ID:</p>

		<p>The goal of MasterKey is attacking all the users who enrolled/will enroll the Speaker Verification systems. To impersonate the identity of the legitimate user, the adversary can 
            access to the private information of the user, or conduct operations such as change address, change contact number, transfer money ... </p>

			<h3>Conventional Backdoor Attack</h3>
            <figure>
            <img src="img/conventional.png" alt="conventional backdoor" width="600" height="350">
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Conventional backdoor attack scenario.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        </center>
            <p class="small-text"> In conventional backdoor attack setting, the adversary prepare a poisoned dataset. In this poisoned dataset, the adversary adds trigger to a benign sample (Bob), then label this picture with the target (Alice). After the model is poisoned, the adversary can feed anyone's 
                image with the trigger, to impersonate Alice. 
            Although this attack succeeds, it has a big assumption, that is, the target label (Alice) is in the clean dataset, and <span class="red-text">the adversary knows that 
            Alice is in the Clean dataset</span>. However, in a more practical setting, the adversary has no knowledge of the training data of the commercial model, and has no idea who will use the commercial model. So, this conventional backdoor attack does not fit our attack goal.</a></p>
			
                <center>
            <h3>Why Conventional Setting Failed?</h3>
            <figure>
            <img src="img/failure.png" alt="fail backdoor" width="600" height="350">
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Failure of the conventional backdoor attack.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
			</center>
            <p class="small-text"> In this case, if the adversary want to attack new targets (Zoe, Leo, Jim), but <span class="red-text">the adversary has no knowledge about the target name when he poison the dataset</span>, the trigger cannot be crafted because the loss requires a specific target label (i.e., Alice in previous Figure 1).
                So the attack will fail. </p>
            <h3>MasterKey Attack</h3>
            <img src="img/masterkey.png" alt="masterkey" width="600" height="350">
			</center>
            <p class="small-text"> In our case, we craft the backdoor by the training data, then assign the backdoor with every training data labels. Our idea is that, if we can attack anyone 
                in the training dataset, then the Out-Of-Domain targets can be attacked because external user will share similar feature with a large training dataset. When the adversary inference the poisoned model by feeding the
                backdoor, the poisoned model will <span class="red-text">produce a embedding that similar to arbitrary targets</span> (e.g., Alice, Bob, Tom, Zoe, Leo, Jim). Therefore, our Masterkey can be used to attack any targets.</p>
